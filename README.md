# Multimodal_classification_of_embedded-images

Images embedded in Documents carry vital information for Content Extraction.
Thus before Interpreting them we need a Classifier that can recognize the potential variability of Embedded Images

#SOLUTION

A Deep Neural Network based classifier with RESNET50 as its feature extractor and a Fully connected classifying unit with layers of dropout regularizer, appended at its end.
